This is the changelog for jom, the parallel build tool.

Changes since jom 0.9.0
- Having too many rules for a target is now a warning and not an error.
- Fixed several bugs in the preprocessor expression parser, e.g.
  QTCREATORBUG-1056.

Changes since jom 0.8.9
- Reset the ERRORLEVEL to zero, if command's exit code should be ignored.
  (QTCREATORBUG-837)
- Command files can be used to pass command line options to jom.
  Usage: jom @commands.txt
- ANTLR isn't used anymore. We're using QLALR to generate the parser for
  preprocessor expressions now. This makes building jom much easier.
